# Pluck.eco Web Frontend

## Setting up the environment

You will need the supabase variables to connect to supabase. Add them to a .env file like this:
`touch .env`
`echo 'PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<supabase-url>.supabase.co' >> .env`
`echo 'PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=the_key_xxx' >> .env`
`echo 'PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/magic-link' >> .env`

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by supabase. Using <https://github.com/magnuswahlstrand/astro-supabase-vercel> as an example, we are able to check the user's login status, or query the database on the server.
This simplifies the frontend (by requiring less javascript to update the page), and speeds up page load for pages that do not need that data.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|   â””â”€â”€ layouts
|       â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                       | Action                                           |

## ðŸ§ª Testing

For testing we will be using the recommended testing frameworks & libraries suggested by [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/testing/#playwright).

Structure of the tests directory:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backend
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2e
```

### Playwright

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for all testing. Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

#### Installation

You can get started and run your tests using the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright).

Alternatively, you can install Playwright within your Astro project using the package manager of your choice. Follow the CLI steps to choose JavaScript/TypeScript, name your test folder, and add an optional GitHub Actions workflow.

```
yarn create playwright
```

Since we are using Playwright for all testing, we need to further install Playwright Test for components for our respective framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.). For example, if you are using React, you would run:

```
npm init playwright@latest -- --ct
```

Note: We need to set the test directory to `tests/frontend/unit` to only run unit tests for our frontend.

#### Create your first Playwright test

Create add a new test file into one of the test folders. Remember to name your test file with the `.spec.ts` extension. For example, `tests/frontend/unit/<name>.spec.ts`.

#### Run your tests

You can run a single test or several tests at once, testing one or multiple browsers. By default, your test results will be shown in the terminal. Optionally, you can open the HTML Test Reporter to show a full report and filter test results. Refer to the commands section
for more details. For more information on running tests, see [Running Tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests).
